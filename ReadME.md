To do :
get a  no sql data base for java fx 
create a settings file to store all the system data
create a welcome page of all the data

**Notes:**

 On terms of using the Hibernate with sqlite database i have reserved it for
 Mysql database as i have faced developement problems that is the version that i
  have managed to find on the internet do not support Sqlite dialects ,  most of them just support Mysql
  Dialects
